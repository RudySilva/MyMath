My Math is a POC to study TDD


The project was created to explore the TDD practices following the instructions of the Microsoft official tutorial: 

WALKTHROUGH: TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT USING TEST EXPLORER

Firstly, I have read the Pluralsight website research that gives a brief explanation of what is TDD and why to use it:

What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a practice that consists in writing the unit tests before the actual methods in a simple way to explain is a cycle of repetition of three steps: Red, green and refactor.

RED: Write the unit test that describes the behaviour expected, but as the method does not exist, it should fail. 

GREEN: Write the actual method in the simplest way to make the test pass.

REFACTOR: Now you can make it better, remove duplication, and make it clean.

Reasons that this practice is not the most executed for most companies:

1) Nobody wants to put the effort into it.

2)People do not think TDD is worth it.

The research: Measures and Categories.

Measures:

Internal quality: Is the code easier to work on and understand?

External quality: Does TDD reduce the number of bugs?

Test quality: Are the tests more effective?

Productivity: Does TDD make developers deliver software faster?

Categories:

Controlled experiments: academic environments.

Pilot studies: less structured tasks.

Semi-industries: professionals on experimental projects or students on real projects.

Industry studies: professionals on real-world projects.

Conclusion

The real project with professionals was the scenario that most had benefits improving internal and external quality, even that you just can experience productivity gains in long term, for me and everyone who spends more time fixing bugs than we think we should agree that is a trade-off, but at the end the of the day, if you write the tests before or after does not have a huge difference as long the final result has unit tests for the critical tasks.
